# Meeting

#### Agenda 


Quick Summary: Good

Feedback:

- The agenda was added on time, and has a very clear structure
- It contains a good amount of points which are very specific and relevant for the current state of the app.
- I really like how you included some proactive points such as discussing strategies for the future etc...
- To improve I would just like to see more of a past-present-future approach. By this I mean, starting of the meeting talking about the tasks that were completed the prior week, then discuss the main talking points to progress, and end with a summary of the action points for the future week. This can be incorporated easily to the agenda by adding one point at the begging e.g "Check-in: How is everyone doing and what has everyone done this week?" and one point at the end: e.g "Summarize action points for the future week".



#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker

Quick Summary: Good

Feedback: 

- The minutes of the previous meeting were highly informative and covered all the agenda points
- It was really clear and easy to follow.
- I would only encourage the future minute takers to assign specific tasks/action points to specific people. Ideally, you should state what each person's issues are for the next week.



#### Chair performance

Quick Summary: Excellent

Feedback: 

- I like how you took initiative of the meeting early on and made sure to start on time despite a member not being there yet.
- There were moments were the meeting pace slowed down a little but mainly due to the technical difficulities and you handled it well.
- You made sure the meeting stayed on track and also even made sure that other member's additions to the agenda were taken into account.


#### Attitude & Relation

Quick Summary: Excellent

Feedback: 

- I feel like the general communication between the team is excellent.
- All your conversations and discussions are constructive and even despite the hybrid setup everyone contributed somewhat equally.
- I especially like the conversation where you were assessing your own strategy of splitting into groups for the featues. Keep this work up!



#### Potentially Shippable Product

Quick Summary: Good

Feedback: 

- Whilst the team was demonstrating the app, I could see that the team made some great progress on both the Multi-collection and Language switch feature.
- It does still seem like there are a few bugs/requirements missing, but the main functionality was present.
- I think that if the team keeps this work up, they will manage to get a nice working application by the end of the project.


#### Work Contribution/Distribution in the Team

Quick Summary: Good

Feedback: 

- From the progess made in the app, I can deduce that most of last week's tasks were completed and split evenly between members
- During the meeting there were some really nice discussions about future issues, however, as mentioned in the Agenda section, it would be nice to follow the past-present-future approach, so that I can further assess you in this section and learn more about your distribution of tasks.
