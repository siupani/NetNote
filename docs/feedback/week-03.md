# Meeting

#### Agenda 
Quick Summary: Good 

Feedback:
 - I think the agenda followed a coherent structure and included very nice and clear points to discuss about.
 - I would encourage you and future chairs to include the  actual questions you want to ask the TA in the agenda, as this will allow me to check before the meeting and discuss it with lecturers if necessary.
 - Also, I would like to see some point in the agenda (doesn't have to be to long) where each of you describe what tasks you've done this week, so I can track your work contribution.


#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker


Quick Summary: Excellent

Feedback: 

- The notes from last week were added shortly after the meeting and were very clear to follow
- They contained just the right amount of information about the meeting and most agreements and tasks were assigned to concrete individuals.
- I also loved the action ponts at the end of the minutes, giving a clear overview of the main tasks to complete for the week.


#### Chair performance

Quick Summary: Good

Feedback: 

- The chair took lead of the meeting quite well and ensured that all topics were covered in the assigned time.
- Moreover, the chair made sure that the meeting stayed on track moving to the next point of the agenda when necessary.
- One thing to improve would be to make sure that all team members were contributing to the meeting. The chair should ensure that those members which are less talkative also share their ideas and opinions during the discussions.




#### Attitude & Relation

Quick Summary: Excellent

Feedback: 

- Once again, the atmosphere was very contructive and people were very open to each other's opinions.
- The only thing I would like to highlight again is the importance that each member contributes somewhat equally to the discussion, which I feel might have not been the case.


#### Potentially Shippable Product

Quick Summary: Excellent

Feedback: 

- The group has made a lot of progress since last week, by implementing the search bar, refresh functionality among other basic requirements.
- I also loved to see how you were already thinking about the usability of the app by implementing key board shortcuts.
- Overall, the team is on a great track to completing the project to a high standard.


#### Work Contribution/Distribution in the Team

Quick Summary: Good

Feedback: 
- The team seems to have reached their goals for last week to a high standard, however, as mentioned in the first section, I would love to hear some discussion from each individual and the tasks they completed during the week.
- From what I can deduce, the work seems to be distributed equally amongst the team and I really enjoyed the discussion about the importance(weight) of some tasks regarding the live language switch feature.
