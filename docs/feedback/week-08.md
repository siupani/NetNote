# Meeting

#### Agenda 

Quick Summary: Good

Feedback:

- The agenda is coherently structured and follows the necessary points from the template project.
- It was very nice that you've added the discussion of tasks at the beginning and end of the meeting, so that the distribution of issues between the team is clear.
- I would only encourage you to include a little more information in the talking points(more bullet points) since its the main part of the meeting.


#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker

Quick Summary: Good

Feedback: 

- I love how you split the notes in different sections, it makes very easy for your team members to read the part that interests them the most. 
- Moreover, the notes contain quite a bit of depth and summarize the discussions during the meeting perfectly
- I would only encourage future minute takers, to assign the agreements/tasks to specific team members


#### Chair performance

Quick Summary: Good

Feedback: 

- I really like how you took lead of the meeting and encouraged an open discussion regarding some interesting topics such as efficient communication between the team.
- I also really liked how you made sure to move on from certain agenda points, to ensure that all points were covered.
- However, I think especially in the middle of the meeting that you lost a bit of track of the points to the point were I wasn't sure were we were in the agenda.



#### Attitude & Relation

Quick Summary: Excellent

Feedback: 

- Like always, the team communicates effectively; each member managed to get their ideas across
- I especially liked how you even discussed difficult topics whilst taking everyone's opinions into account such as the miscommunication when planning monday's meeting
- Overall, the athmosphere within the team was constructive and everyone contributed.


#### Potentially Shippable Product

Quick Summary: Good

Feedback: 

- The group manged to make some nice progress after receiving the feedback this weekend.
- Quite a bit of progress made in regards to key board shortcuts, config file and persisting the language.
- With these improvements and the fixing of the search bar functionality i believe the team already has a functional app meeting most basic requirements and completing 2 features to a high standard.


#### Work Contribution/Distribution in the Team


Quick Summary: Good

Feedback: 

- The team discussed the previous tasks completed in detail and from this I saw that all action points were met.
- Also, by the action points completed, I realised that the team took quick action to fix any issues mentioned in the feedback, which is great.
- During the meeting, the team mentioned how they wanted to start working on the embedded files features. During this, I would have loved to see some discussion about the distribution of this feature between team members.
