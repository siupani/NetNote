# Meeting 

#### Agenda 

Mark: Good

Feedback:
The agenda was added to the repository on time, allowing for other team members to prepare for the meeting. The agenda does follow the template and is quite clear to understand, however, the time estimates for certain points were a bit off, causing the meeting to be a little short.
 


#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker

Mark: Good

Feedback: 
The notes/minutes covered most of the points discussed in the meeting in quite a bit of depth. To improve, I would encourage to make the structure of the minutes more clear, so its easier to read and understand the notes as it just looks like a paragraph of text.



#### Chair performance

Grade: Sufficient

Feedback: 
I think you started the meeting quite well, making sure that the points were addressed, however, while the meeting progressed you stopped leading the meeting so well and some of your team members took over the meeting a little. I also think that at some points during the meeting, converstations went a little off track in regards to the agenda points. I noticed this specifically when discussing the issue of the project not working on different machines. It is important to note that the chair is responsible for making sure that the meeting stays on track, and that all the points in the agenda are discussed according to the time estimates..


#### Attitude & Relation
Mark: Excellent

Feedback: 
I think the team did really well in regard to this aspect of the feedback. Everyone was quite involved in the meeting, discussing their ideas and opinions about the progress of the project. I like how you made agreements and the whole atmosphere was very constructive. 


#### Potentially Shippable Product

Mark: Excellent

Feedback: 
The team seems to have made some good progress with the project. They  have managed to start their own application and added the functionality of adding notes. There was also some great progess in the frontend and the incorporation of the markdown functionality. Please keep up the good work!
 


#### Work Contribution/Distribution in the Team

Mark: Good

Feedback: 
I think that the action goals from last week were achieved nicely, since the code of conduct seems to be almost done. I also think that the task distribution was quite good, as people were assigned manageable issues on GitLab.
