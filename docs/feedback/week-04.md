# Meeting

#### Agenda

Quick Summary: Good

Feedback:

- Some really nice points were included in the agenda; I especially liked how you talked about setbacks encountered the previous week and how to overcome them
- Overall, the agenda was very clear, I would only encourage you to include the planned meeting duration in order to check if you're estimates are somewhat right.

#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker

Quick Summary: Good

Feedback: 

- The notes were added shortly after the meeting. 
- All the points in the agenda were nicely addressed in the minutes and included the right amount of depth.
- Some of the the concrete agreements were assigned to people but I would also like to some concrete tasks assigned to each of the members(to be completed for each week).


#### Chair performance

Quick Summary: Good

Feedback: 
- I think you took lead of the meeting quite well at the beginning and covered all the points that were in the agenda to the right amount of depth
- However, I did notice that at times there were quite a bit of moments of silence where the meeting sort of momentarily stopped. I am aware that this is more complicated to handle in a hybrid setup up, but for the future make sure that you move from point to point a little faster.


#### Attitude & Relation

Quick Summary: Insufficient

Feedback: 

- I feel like the contributions made by team members were quite productive and members were actively listening to each other.
- I don't think that all members contributed equally to the discussion. Some members even stayed muted the entire meeting or barely spoke in discussions.
- More talkative members (especially the chair) should try to encourage all members to voice their opinions througout the meeting.



#### Potentially Shippable Product


Quick Summary: Good

Feedback: 

- Some nice prgress was made compared to last week, especially with regards to the multi-collection and live language feature.
- I would encourage you to continue working on these and make sure that they are soon to be completed(make sure the language change persists through different pages etc...)
- I still think this team is working at a good pace to deliver a very nice working application in the end.


#### Work Contribution/Distribution in the Team

Quick Summary: Sufficient

Feedback: 

- I think some of the action goals of last week were completed, but  not fully.
- I feel like with the midterm week, most of you worked on the action points last minute which created some conflicts and lead to some of you not meeting the knockout criteria
- You should try to avoid this in the future and make sure that you distribute more tasks between you since you've now lost a member.
