# Meeting

#### Agenda 
Mark: Sufficient

Feedback:The agenda included some very nice points and was coherently structured. I really liked how you included the strength/weakeness point in this introductory meeting 
as it allowed you to get to know each other. 
I would say that in the future, you could split up the agenda points a little more. For example, you set 20 mins to talk about
the code of coduct, but i think it would have been better to have each of the discussion points(e.g decision making, communication) as seperate point in the agenda. This would have allowed you to keep track of time a little better.





#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker

Not applicable to this meeting.


#### Chair performance
Mark: Sufficient

Feedback: The chair was quite good at ensuring the points of the agenda were covered and lead the meeting with confidence.
I would say that one thing to keep in mind are the timings of the points in the agenda, since there were some discrepencies, 
as well as making sure that all team members contribute to the group discussion.


#### Attitude & Relation

Mark: Good

Feedback: Everyone contributed to the meeting and the atmosphere was quite constructive, while discussing the major action points. 
The ideas discussed by individuals were taken into account and the team took ownership of the meeting early on.
I would only encourage for all team members to try and contribute during these discussions somewhat equally since I felt that some team members spoke more than others.



#### Potentially Shippable Product

Not applicable to this meeting.


#### Work Contribution/Distribution in the Team

Mark: Sufficient

Feedback:
Since it's only the first week, I will only dedicate this section to  discuss your task distribution, but bare in mind that next week, I will also assess whether the goals you set during this meeting are completed. Regarding the task distribution, I've noticed how most of the tasks set were individual self-study tasks. This is somewhat fine for the first week, but I would have also liked to hear you discuss how you plan to work on the code of conduct.
