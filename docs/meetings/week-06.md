# Minutes of the Meeting

## Development Tasks
- The work on collections and language features is not yet complete, so we will not begin developing new features until these are finalized.
- **Tasks for this week:**
  - **Fix bugs**:
    - Notes currently share the same title ("New Note") upon creation.
    - The "Move Collection" feature is not fully functional.
  - Adapt the collections scene to match the example provided in the product backlog.
  - Inform users about the server status.
  - Enable the default collection selection (currently hardcoded).
  - Use a local configuration file for storing collections.
  - Link the collections scene to language features.
  - **Maximize feature implementation points**:
    - Add personal improvements to each feature to enhance user experience (HCI). These improvements should exceed explicit requirements in the backlog.

## Project Management
- No additional meeting will be held this week due to clear action points and it being a resit week.
  - Task assignments align with members' previous work areas.
- **Documentation**:
  - Update the ReadMe file with instructions for using features corresponding to basic requirements by **Friday** (implementation deadline).
- **Issues and Merge Requests**:
  - Before starting a task:
    - Create a detailed issue.
    - Add the issue to the appropriate weekly milestone.
  - Include screenshots and extended explanations in merge requests.
  - Track time and provide accurate estimations for tasks.
  - **Branches**:
    - There are 13 branches currently; clean up useless ones.
  - Merge Requests:
    - Never approve a merge request without adding comments.
    - Assign reviewers (team members) from your “mini-team” to review your work.
- **Team Structure**:
  - Continue using the two-team split strategy as it has been effective.
  - Teams should regularly present their work to each other to ensure everyone understands the codebase.
- **Grading**:
  - Review the grading rubrics thoroughly.
  - Avoid repeating past mistakes, as these last weeks are critical for the project grade.

## Miscellaneous Points
- The knockout criteria email will be sent this afternoon (**Wednesday, January 8th**).
- Guus has been removed from the team, leaving 5 members.
- Lines of code from the previous sprint will count toward the grade, even with failing pipelines, contrary to normal standards.
