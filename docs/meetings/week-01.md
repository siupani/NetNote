Minute taker notes:
Agenda:
Agenda adapted to fit into the 45 minutes of time with the TA. No additions added to the agenda.

What is discussed:
Bullet point 3(6.5 min): 
3*Have we done the git assignment, what did everyone get (pass/fail)?
3*Need to setup template project ASAP, due Friday 22-11-2024
3*Check what is needed to do from Monday through Sunday.
3*Check out the rubrics and base your project upon those.
3*Get familiar with spring and java development by doing the self-study
3*Meeting is about getting to know each other, how are we splitting and approaching tasks?
3*Knockout is already starting next week
Bullet point 4(1 min):
4* Comment by TA about agenda length.
Bullet point 5(35 min):
5*If TA meeting isn't enough when and where do we meet again?
RESP - if needed will be meet in the Lab after the TA-meeting, otherwise contact eachother through whatsapp or discord via text or call.
5* Obective: Aim for a grade higher than 8/9 on this project. And aim for extra features.
5* Strong points of some are prior knowledge to java(effects) and webdesign. Everyone is eager to learn and catchup.
5* Checkstyle rules were discussed (not all 10 just a couple), 
outcome would be naming conventions(camelCase), (recommended by TA) looking at the OOP rules and modify and explaining methods.
5*We are a team what would be the Team Tactics? 
RESP - teamwork and communication are key, no need to be affraid, if anyone struggles or has something to say just send a message.
5*COC (done this friday):gone over most points partially answered: 
Everyone reads the assingments, so everyone is up to date. And we know everyone is commited.
What to do if someone bothers the rest? First reach out to the one bothering(1), otherwise reach out to external sources like the TA.
Bothering in the sense of not reaching out, a lack of interest or not responding in a reasonable amount of time.

How did we come to an outcome?:
We came to an outcome by going arround everyone so everyone could give their opinion and all agree on one thing or part in the middle.

Purpose of meeting:
The purpose of this meeting was mostly to discuss and decide the first couple of options.

Task division:
Everyone reads the assignments and do the self-study on their own for now.
Discord server made by Sergiu. For meeting and sharing code.
Read the backlog.
We did not divide the tasks yet because we are still preparing.
